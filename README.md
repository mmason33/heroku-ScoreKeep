# Score Keep app

An application built with:

### Meteor.js and React.js
I wanted to learn more about Meteor's Distributed Data Protocal(DPP). Instances of the database are stored in the client using MiniMongo. Each time there is a change on a given client, each instance of the application is updated. MiniMongo is constantly syncing data between clients. Really cool technology.

*Tip: Open this application in several different windows or devices to see DDP at work.*
